* The extension is now include in the URL when generating a request. This means
  that any URL handlers which handle requests including an extension will need
  to be updated to include the extension.

  main ones are:
  * `SS_HTTPRequest::send_file()` has been moved to `HTTP::send_file()`
  * `SS_HTTPRequest->param()` has been renamed to `getParam()`
  * `SS_HTTPRequest->allParams()` has been renamed to `getParams()`
* Deprecated `Profiler` class, use third-party solutions like [xhprof](https://github.com/facebook/xhprof/)
* Removed defunct or unnecessary debug GET parameters: 
  `debug_profile`, `debug_memory`, `profile_trace`, `debug_javascript`, `debug_behaviour`
