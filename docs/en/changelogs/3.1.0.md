# 3.1.0 (unreleased)

## Overview ##

## Upgrading

* The rewrite functionality has been updated to operate differently, so you will
  need to replace your `.htaccess` file with the new version. **If you do not
  replace your `.htaccess` file your site will not work**.
* Deprecated `Profiler` class, use third-party solutions like [xhprof](https://github.com/facebook/xhprof/)
* Removed defunct or unnecessary debug GET parameters: 
  `debug_profile`, `debug_memory`, `profile_trace`, `debug_javascript`, `debug_behaviour`
